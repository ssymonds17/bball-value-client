### Summary

This website uses a custom metric to provide an alternative method for historical player evaluation. Too often current evaluation is boiled down to sometimes arbritary statistics (like number of championships won) and misses out on the valuable context that provides key information required for substantial player evaluation. 
My custom metric is based on several existing publicly available advanced statistics and is applied to all players in both the NBA and ABA's history.
This website is a showcase for this information in a simple and easily navigable layout akin to similar websites like [Basketball Reference] or [Baseball Reference].
